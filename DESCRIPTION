Description: Black-Scholes Model [Black (1973) <doi:10.1086/260062>] is important to calculate option premium in the stock market. And variety of improved models are studied. In this package, I proposed functions in order to calculate normal and new Jump Diffusion Models [Kou (2002) <doi:10.1287/mnsc.48.8.1086.166>] by Monte Carlo Method. This package can be used for Computational Finance.
