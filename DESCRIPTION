Description: Black-Scholes model is important to calculate option premium in stock market. And variety of jump diffusion models are studied. In this package, we propose new jumps diffusion model with correlational companies in order to calculate option price in a stock market. This model expresses correlation of companies as directed graph structures that have a weight of correlation coefficients among companies and calculates option premiums together.
